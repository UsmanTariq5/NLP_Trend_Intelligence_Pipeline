# DVC Pipeline Configuration
# Note: For this assignment, data files are tracked individually with 'dvc add'
# This file serves as documentation of the pipeline stages

# Pipeline stages (for reference):
# 1. scrape_data: Collect tech product data from GitHub API
# 2. preprocess_data: Clean and normalize text data
# 3. generate_features: Create BoW, vocab, and n-gram representations
# 4. compute_statistics: Generate linguistic intelligence report

# To run the full pipeline manually:
# python src/scraper.py
# python src/preprocess.py
# python src/representation.py
# python src/statistics.py
